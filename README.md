# smallsh

The small shell project was not the final project for the Operating Systems course, but it was the most 
robust, as well as my favorite. This project is used to demonstrate knowledge of the Linux operating system
by creating our own shell prompt in the C language, allowing a user to run commands as any shell should. 
It is capable of running programs in the foreground and background, manage spawned processes, route input and 
output to specified files, and even has signal handlers that reroute default signal functions.
